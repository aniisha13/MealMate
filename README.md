# MealMate

My project, MealMate, is an innovative website tailored to meet the dietary needs of students and individuals living away from home, ensuring they receive proper meals on time. MealMate features a robust database that meticulously stores user details and mess information, facilitating a seamless user experience. The website's standout feature is its geolocation filter, which allows users to find mess options based on their current location effortlessly. Additionally, MealMate provides a direct call and chat option, enabling users to communicate with vendors without any third-party interference. This project aims to bridge the gap between users and meal providers, offering a convenient and efficient solution for daily meal requirements.
